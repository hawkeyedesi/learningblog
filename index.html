Hello and welcome to my blog.

On this page I try to maintain notes on intersting papers related to computer vision, medical imaging and deep learning. Given that this template from fastai allows for code demonstrations, I hope to add a few bits of it which will help enhance the concepts that are being reviewed. 

Furthermore, time permitting, I will try to write a blog on papers I have recently published.


It is inspired by [Patrick Liu](https://github.com/patrick-llgc/Learning-Deep-Learning) and this site is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)

            "content": "[REVIEW] Weight Agnostic Neural Networks . Resources . Arxiv Paper | Blogpost | Slides | Blog Github | Tutorial on MDL | . Note: I am basing everything in these notes from the excellent blog post. I haven’t gone through the paper yet. . tl;dr: The paper introduces a method of designing neural network architectures that are not dependent on the node weights. Rather the trick here is to let the network evolve its architecture such that the architecture itself has the capacity required to solve the required tasks. The authors draw analogies with precocial animals such as snakes and iguanas wherein they are wired to run away from the prey. . Overall impression . I think its a very cool concept in its nascent stages they have shown how without the burden of weight training, they employed a topology-based algorithm (NEAT) to find and grow the topology. . Key ideas . Quoting from the blog: . While the aforementioned works focus on the information capacity required to represent the weights of predefined network architecture, in this work we focus on finding minimal architectures that can represent solutions to various tasks. . By making the network be independent of the weights or the tuning and solely depending on the architecture the work can use other algorithms besides gradient descent and backprop such as NEAT to solve the architecture . | By weight sharing across the entire network with the weighting treated as a random sample from a uniform random distribution. . | Introducing more than the common (e.g. linear, sigmoid, ReLU) and more exotic (Gaussian, sinusoid, step), the network is learning to include more of these connections. . | By replacing the grunt work of the weights as filters, this work is now forcing the network connections to provide the right weighting or inductive biases for that particular problem. . | Further, instead of fixing the structure of the network and then biasing the weights of the network to solve a specific problem, you are instead relying on the network architecture structure. . | By introducing nodes with a lot more sets of options such as inv, sin, cost gaussian, bias, etc (See paper and the code for details) you are replicating the functions a weight-based filter would do. That is a pretty cool concept. . | Unlike NAS or other operations wherein you have to run the network every single time to compute a metric (for eg. accuracy) to see the performance, this proposed method instead just goes with random permutations of the network (I am assuming that’s what the random trial paper does or some flavor of it). . | . Technical details . Not merely any weight agnostic neural network but one that can be described using a minimum descriptor length. . | Significance of minimum description length models when choosing the weight agnostic NN: Using MDL inference, you are ensuring that the model that is being selected is the simplest one while still ensuring that it works just as well as the more complex network architectures. . | . Notes . Inductive Biases in Machine learning are a set of assumptions that the model learns to make during training to predict the unseen target data accurately. This website on inductive bias has a nice list of biases that are present for every task. . | What is Minimum Description Length: MDL is an inference method that provides a generic solution to the model inference problem. The definition states that when you have different models that perform just as well, using MDL for model selection will ensure that you pick the simplest model that still performs as well as the more complex models. . | Questions and notes on how to improve/revise the current work How would it work for more complicated semi-supervised and supervised problems? | Are there more creative and interesting node functions to pick from that will help improve this? | What happens if you start allowing more interesting connections such as skip connections in the feed-forward directions. Can you even do that and can it be optimized using the NEAT algorithm?   Things I don’t understand  . | . | What are the connection cost technique and I am not sure how it relates to the NEAT algorithm for model growing? . | Further, how does dominance relations work to rank the networks based on mean overall performance, the weight values (how does it perform for the fixed selected weight. The paper chose a range between [-2,2]), max performance of the single best value and the number of connections in the network. . | Does the domain relation ranking also consider the MDL inference internally and if so how? I still need to read those topics. | .",

            "title": "Self_attention_iclr2020",
            "content": "[REVIEW] On the Relationship between Self Attention and Convolutional Layers . Background: . This paper banks on the concept of transformers and self attention both of which are foriegn to me. So i start out doing a brief review on what the two concepts are and then move onto what this paper does and how it uses them. . Review of the Illustrated Transformer Blog Post. To start off with you need to first get an understanding of the attention mechanism in the Seq2Seq models starting here . Key Ideas from the two blog posts on attention and transformers: . Attention Mechanism: . The attention mechanism is the same concept as the attention that we think of in computer vision as heatmaps. In there the common practise is to use a grad-cam to backpropogate and weight the regions of the image which correspond to that class output. The same concept applies here as well. You use the idea of weighting the hidden layers of the encoder for every step of the decoder to highlight the importance. This is used along with the hidden layer of the decoder to predict the output of every step of the decoder. . | One key difference in using attention networks versus classic seq-to-seq networks is the amount of information that gets passed onto the decoder. In classic case only the final Hidden State is passed to the decoder. Here all the hidden states are passed. . | At each time step of the decoder, each of the hidden layers from the encoder is then weighted according to the scoring function (normalized) to give higher importance or attention to the relavent hidden state. . | Further in transformers there is an attention mechanism in the encoder part as well . | Note that the scoring is calculated at each time step of the decoder. . | . This excellent illustration from Jay Alammar shows a gist of the seq2seq with attention. Plese refer to the original blogpost for further details: . Your browser does not support the video tag. The transformer: . The transform is a different beast from what we have seen with the standard CNNs. It’s also based on the attention mechanism but in a highly structured way. Compared to the earlier attention mechanism in the seq2seq work with attention, this one has three different parts (Query, Key, Value) to the self-attention mechanism. . | The entire transformer network idea is to increase the number of self-attention heads and initialize them randomly so that you have enough different WQ,WK,WVW_Q, W_K, W_VWQ​,WK​,WV​ matrices trained to ensure that the words are propoerly attended to. . | Further the decoder part of the network also has a similar attention mechanism to attend to the enconding output vectors. Unlike the original seq2seq with attention, here the network looks at the key and the value embeddings produced from the output of the final layer of the encoder. The weighting provided by the Query term of the decoder which only looks at the earlier positions of the output sequence is used to weight the attention for each decoder vector. . | Two additional conceps of residual connections and positional encodings for the input vector embeddings are used to further enchance the network. Residual connections function similar to the residual blocks that are used in Resnets and DenseNets of computer vision, i.e. they reduce the problem of vanishing gradient which will affect such huge networks like the transformers. The positional encoding is an intersting idea. They way I think of it is to liken it to a method which helps spatially encoder the positioning. The original paper broke the two halves of the 512 vector embedding into sine and cosine based embedding vectors and then concatenated them. . | . Additional Resource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBCqOTEfxvg http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html - A full step by step implementation of the paper with comments. . . Arxiv paper: ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SELF-ATTENTION AND CONVOLUTIONAL LAYERS . Blog post: http://jbcordonnier.com/posts/attention-cnn/ . tl;dr: Self attention can express convolutional layer and the filters can be learnt in practise. The authors prove a theorem showing that with enough attention head, the self-attention can generalize the convolutional layer. I still haven’t read the paper in detail but their blog post gave me enough of an idea to understand what the paper is doing . Overall impression . Intersting take on correlating the attention head and cnns for images. The CNNs were originally designed to have limited to small fixed kernels which translated across the image to avoid having the whole image have differnt kernel weights. Now with the attention, it can attend to the whole image once again by posing it as an attention query problem. . Key ideas . Having multi head attention can generalize a CNN. Paper proves this theorem. | With multiple heads ensures that all areas of the imgage are attended to. | With positional encoding the problem of attention mechanism having equivariance is allieviated. | Results on CFAIR show comparable performance to standard CNNs | . Technical details . Attention mechanism translated from 1D to images: Basically instead of having token length embeddings for every word every single pixel i,ji,ji,j is assigned a key - value score. There is a bit of notation abuse in the paper wherin every ApA_pAp​ and XpX_pXp​ denotes a 2D index corresponding to the (x,y)(x,y)(x,y) pixel position. | . Notes . Questions and notes on how to improve/revise the current work Authors propose conditioning the receptive field on the input pixels | Can this attention mechanism improve explainability. Can we better visualize what each region of the multiple heads are attending to for a given pixel or a region of pixels? | Using transformers causes an explosion of paramters. And the main factor which is limiting it is the assumption that you take every pixel i,ji,ji,j and attend to it. One simplification is to replicate what the embedding vector does in NLP. The same words would have the same embeddings. Maybe a simplification would be to have key-value pairs based on pixel intensity? Will the work out? | . | . I skimmed the proof because I really don’t have any experience understanding what it is doing. .",

The innovative thing they show here is that by approximating the piecewise continuous outputs from a combinatorial optimizer to make it continuous we can backpropagate the gradients to also learn the feature representations of the deep learner.   Also disclaimer: This is all that I understood from the blog post and haven’t read the paper in detail. . Overall impression . I think it is a cool idea that you can present to the combinatorial optimization a set of learnable features for the problem using such a rich feature representer like deep learning while also solving complex combinatorial optimization. .
